# TEKWAR
TEKWAR for DOS

# LEGAL
Les Bird released the code after capstone went under.  The legality of the source is in question but so far, there has been no issues with other ports (JFTekwar etc..).

# Compiling
WATCOM 10/11 is required

For the Assembler files, I have converted them to TASM from WASM, so use the Borland TASM assembler.

BUILD:
wmake BUILD.MAK

TEKWAR:
TEKWAR.BAR

Enjoy the best build engine game ever!
